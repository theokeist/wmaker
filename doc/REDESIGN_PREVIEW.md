# Redesign Preview Checklist

This guide lists the quickest way to experience the current visual refresh
work—especially the new aspect-aware scaling pipeline—after building Window
Maker from source.

## 1. Build the tree

1. From the repository root, run the usual Autotools sequence:
   ```sh
   ./autogen.sh   # only when building from git
   ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
   make -j$(nproc)
   make install
   ```
2. Launch an X session (or Xephyr) and export `PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH` so
the freshly built binaries are used.

## 2. Explore the WINGs-driven preferences UI

1. Start the preferences application with `WPrefs.app/WPrefs`.
2. In **Appearance ▸ Smooth Scaling**, toggle the sample button: the WINGs
   widget loads the legacy preview and the smooth variant via the new
   fit-to-box helpers so you can compare the two renditions instantly.
3. Open **Icons ▸ Icon Size** and drag the new pixel slider across a wide
   range (from 16 up to 512). The label updates live and the preference is
   stored verbatim, so you can experiment with supersized dock tiles without
   being locked to 8 px increments.
4. In the same panel, tweak **Mini-Previews**—the preview swatch is scaled with
   the same helpers the core window manager now uses for dock previews.
5. Switch to **Effects ▸ Animations & Effects** and choose easing curves for
   window moves and application launches; the pop-ups write their selection
   straight to the defaults database for the core to consume. Enable
   **Show window contents during animations** and pick a compositor (such as
   Picom) from the same panel to capture snapshots and let the Glide animation
   fade smoothly when a compositor is running.
6. Hop back to **Icons ▸ Iconification Animation** and pick the new
   *Glide* style—paired with the content toggle above it drives the ARGB
   overlay used by the compositor-friendly minimize animation.

These panels are powered by the WINGs toolkit, but the actual pixel work is
handled by the raster library. The integration mirrors how a full GNUstep
stack would split UI chrome (WINGs) from lower-level rendering.

## 3. Validate runtime icons and dock tiles

1. Start (or restart) Window Maker with `wmaker --replace` so the new binaries
   own the session.
2. Watch dock icons, switch panels, and appicons: the window manager now runs
   every icon through the fit-to-box scaler, avoiding the stretched artefacts
   that used to occur when bitmaps exceeded their slot.
3. Trigger mini-previews (hover a clip or dock tile) to see the smoother
   thumbnails generated by the shared helpers.

With these steps you can confirm that the redesigned rendering path lands all
the way from WINGs-based configuration tools to the core window-manager
surfaces.
